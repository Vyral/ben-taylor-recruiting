Part three of our series looks at the fundamental concepts found in Millionaire Real Estate Agent.

Welcome to the final part in my series detailing the Keller Williams 12x12 programme. It’s our approach to getting an agent into production as quickly as possible, which is crucial to an agent’s success when building their own business. Today’s focus will be on **Millionaire Real Estate Agent (MREA)** by Gary Keller.

Many people dismiss the MREA book because they believe it’s only written for the American market, but what it provides us is a model. It’s a template that helps you build a great business, regardless of where you are in the world.

MREA introduces three important concepts to a property market business: **Leads, listings, and leverage**. You must be **leveraging** out less important tasks so you’re allowed to focus on high-earning activities. You need listings to earn sales. **Leads** for these listings come from building a big **database** of potential clients to earn business from.

How do you build this database? In today’s world, many of us have a wealth of contacts already on our phones. You have something to share with those contacts: You are starting a property market business and want them to know why. We have **reached** out to them, and now we can **capture** them when they respond. From here, we **nurture** relationships. We begin offering our value with updates on schools, our market, and other information. Finally, we **convert** them into referrals or customers.

In the Keller Williams programme, we also use the **33 or 36 touch** systems. These are the number of different ways we can make regular contact, such as with a card, phone call, or networking event. Then we incorporate the **8x8 and 12 direct** systems we covered in previous videos.

It is easier than ever to reach and capture new members for your database, and the Keller Williams systems and models are incredibly effective at building it even further. If you are looking to start out in estate agency and build your own business using our unique structure, then get in touch today.

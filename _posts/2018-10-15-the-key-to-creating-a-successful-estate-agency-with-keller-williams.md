<center><em>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;the big why&rdquo; and why is it so important to an agent&rsquo;s development within the Keller Williams system? We&rsquo;re going to explore the answer to that question today.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Welcome back to my series detailing the Keller Williams 12x12 program. It’s our approach to getting an agent into production as quickly as possible, which is crucial to an agent’s success when building their own business.

Last time, we talked about thinking really big but starting small. **Today the focus is going to be on “the big why.”** If you’re going out to your marketplace and saying that you want everyone to choose you to buy and sell a property because you want to make a load of money and buy a flashy car, I’m afraid your business isn’t going to do very well. With great respect, nobody cares about what car you’re driving and what your personal motivations are. Here's what I think a really good “why” is from personal experience.

When I bought my last house, I viewed the property the day it came onto the market. Where I live, a property with a room at the side, a room at the front, and a really big garden doesn’t come around very often. In fact, it’s very rare. When I viewed the property in the morning, I made an offer that was considerably under the asking price.

The agent who listed the property was the No. 1 agent in town at the time. When I made the offer, they said to me: “That should be fine, but I need to talk to the owner.” All they needed to do was say “We’re not going to be recommending that the owner take anything off the price. This is an amazing house with an amazing opportunity.” **That would have made tens of thousands of pounds worth of difference to the owner of the home**.

So, why am I motivated to make sure that everybody chooses me? **It comes down to two things:**

**1. I protect the client’s interests in a way that I haven’t seen any other agent protect them**. I protect them on price, I protect the level of service we give them, and I really take care of them. I not only want them to refer me again, but I want them to refer anyone they care about that needs some advice on property to me. That’s a really powerful thing.

**2. Procurement**. It might sound a bit pompous to use the word “procure”, but here’s what I mean by it. I want to extract the maximum value we can for that client. That’s what a great agent is supposed to do. My job is to sell their property for the highest price I can while protecting their best interests.

In the end, what resonates most with people is what you believe in. If you believe what I believe, then we have a much better chance at connecting. I believe that clients’ interests need protecting, particularly in a system that allows a buyer or seller to pull out at any stage right up to the exchange of contract.&nbsp;

So before you go out there and say, “Hey listen to me, everyone!” Get ready with what you’re going to say and make sure what you’re going to say is worthwhile before you say it. The things that we teach revolve around protecting clients and protecting clients’ interests. **That is a “why” that most clients will find most appealing**.

To those of you who are interested in how Keller Williams helps people build the big “why”s &nbsp;for their lives, we actually run courses called “1,3, 5” and “4-1-1”, which I’ll be running videos on in the near future.

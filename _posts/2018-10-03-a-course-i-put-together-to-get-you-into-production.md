<center><em>The first step to my 12x12 short course to get you started in production and get cash flowing.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Today I want to talk about what to expect if you are joining Keller Williams. As the world’s No. 1 training company, there is a wealth of training with no shortage of courses.

However, I wanted to put something very specific together for you about getting into production and getting cash flow into your business as quickly as possible.

To show you how to do this, **I have put together a course called 12x12**. This new resource is a combination of the things that we teach within Keller Williams plus my many years of experience working for an agency condensed into one short course. Over the next few videos, I will share the steps with you of the 12x12.

So, what is 12x12 and why is it called this? I wanted to create something that allows agents to take instructions on three properties per week within 12 weeks of joining the business. This gives you 12 properties to list per month. If you have seen some of my previous videos, you know that 12 instructions in our business, even when selling a very low percentage of those instructions, will provide you enough to get your business motoring and generate you some significant income.

At the end of the 12x12, you will have what we call a “30, 60, 90.” These are 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day plans. **This gives you a very clear plan of what to do every 30 days throughout this model**. If you do these things and are disciplined about doing each of them, you will get the outcome previously described.

The first thing that we teach is that, whilst we want people to think big in both life and building your business, you must start small. Start by thinking about the practicalities of becoming a great estate agent in a specific area. A really great agent knows about a specific area’s schools, commutes, the new deli that is opening, and all the tidbits and lovely things people living there find important.

A good example to look at with this is London. If you tried to be an expert across all of London, that would be ridiculous because it is far too large–there are 120,000 people who move a year across London. Instead, **you can choose a specific area with enough people moving within the small market share to allow you to get a good number of properties on the market**.

You do not want to be bigger than that because you want to be a local expert and be known as the go-to person. You need to realistically be there for authenticity because it will endear people. Don’t tell people you’re an expert and not be an expert.

Even if there are 100 properties in the given area, that is a lot of people to communicate with on a personal, bespoke way. They need an agent who really wants to look after them on an individual basis.

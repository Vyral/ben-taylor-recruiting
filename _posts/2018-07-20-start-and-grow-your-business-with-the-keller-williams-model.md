Over the past few months, I have been speaking with agents who are debating about whether or not joining Keller Williams was the right choice for them. Many people talk to me about what is stopping them from starting their own company and what is keeping them outside of a model like Keller Williams.

For this reason, I want to discuss pain points, as well as share how the Keller Williams systems and models can make a big difference for you, and how it will enable you to start your own company at a very low cost, all while building a lifestyle around your business.

**One of your biggest assets is time**. If you sell all of your time for a basic, low salary working from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., you are giving away that time for a relatively low amount. In London, the average basic salary for a negotiator is £19,000. This means that you are only making around £1,350 per month, with which it is difficult to start to build or create wealth.

**The second thing to consider is how much commission you give away during every transaction**. Just like any business, you've got to look at your revenue. While many agents look at how much they’re receiving, I look at how much they’re giving away. Instead of getting 10%, you are giving away 90%, which makes it hard to generate any real business of your own.

Finally, **you need to consider your database**. Your database is a list of clients who you are going to deal with for a lifetime. They are the people who will recommend you to their children when they are considering buying or letting. You want to be their adviser. Normally, here in the UK, we do not build any clients at all because ultimately the clients are owned by the business paying your salary.

I became involved with Keller Williams because I saw it as an opportunity to provide you with not only a physical place to work but also instructions and training, all for a small fee. **In London, the £250 plugs you into all the systems and models of Keller Williams while making it very easy for you to run your business**.

With our model, once you have paid 10% into Keller Williams, there is then 90% of the transaction remaining. Now, up to what we call a “cap,” the agent still receives 70%. What does this mean? It means one single transaction in most parts of the country can make the difference. It is the equivalent of selling as many as 15 to 20 houses in a more traditional model, which means you can get into a place where you are creating revenue for yourself and, therefore, your business much more quickly.

The remaining 30%, meanwhile, goes to the market centre to pay for things like Rightmove, Zoopla, LonRes, etc. Once the cap is contributed, there is no more 30%, and you receive 90% of every transaction that you do.

In later videos, I will talk about how to build your own database. With Keller Williams, we teach you how to grow it and build it out as your own. Of course, this means you also get to keep the revenue of each of the transactions you are putting together.

**This is a really transformational way to create wealth**. Even better, the customers are going to win here as well because they are getting someone who is truly facilitated with everything they need. You have the technology, training, and facilities to be able to deliver great service to the customer. We think this is truly very exciting.

The final piece that is very relevant in today’s world is that **you get more flexibility**. For example, last week I was able to go to my boys' sports days one day after the next. In my previous world, I would have missed one of these days, probably even both. However, with Keller Williams it was not a problem, and I was able to attend both days. Having that flexibility makes a huge difference, and to be able to work and grow your business around the lifestyle you want to have, I think is important.
